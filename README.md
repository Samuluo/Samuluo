## Hi there ðŸ‘‹



I am **Samuluo**, a second-year graduate student. I am currently studying at the School of Computer Science, Sichuan University. I graduated from the School of Software Engineering, Sichuan University for my undergraduate studies.

My current research interests include array signal processing (fonus on sound source localization), deep learning, and acoustic anomaly detection. Previously, I have worked in Java web development. My hobbies include web development, LLM, and AI agents.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently studying in Sichuan Unveristy,
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Array Signal Proccessing, combining with some deep learning methods
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with LLM, AI agent
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Signal Proccessing
